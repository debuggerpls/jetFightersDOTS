## Retro game Jet Fighters implemented in Unity DOTS

Notice: I am trying Unity DOTS out, while being a beginner gamedeveloper.

TODO:
* find a way to create or instantiate prefabs without them spawning (for a short duration) at their initial position.
* find a better game state way, instead of creating tags which enable the system for specific actions
* find an alternative to using singletons for gameinformation and settings
